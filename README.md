# import_piped_image_files
Utility to read STDIN files output by "find" and move then to a $HOME/Pictures/YYYY/MM/DD folder structure

## Usage
Program to process a list of image files piped from find
It places (moves) them into $HOME/Pictures/YYYY/MM/DD folder:
YYYY: year
MM: month
DD: day
being YYYY/MM/DD the date of taken shot.

It uses great "exiftool" program to isolate "Date/Time Original" tag and to use the YYYY/MM/DD data to address the destination folder.
If the image file does NOT have that "Date/Time Original" tag, that file will be skipped (and therefore not imported (moved)).



## Example
```
find . -type f -iname "*jpg" -o -name "*CR2" | ./import_piped_image_files.sh
```
